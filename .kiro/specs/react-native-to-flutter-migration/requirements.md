# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the existing React Native/Expo "SmartBudget AI" application to Flutter. The migration will preserve all existing functionality while leveraging Flutter's cross-platform capabilities and performance benefits. The current app includes onboarding flows, user authentication, glassmorphism UI design, 3D animations, and a budget tracking dashboard.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Flutter app to have the same visual design and user experience as the current React Native app, so that the migration feels seamless and familiar.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Flutter app launches THEN the system SHALL display the same glassmorphism design with blur effects and gradient backgrounds
2. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide the same 3D floating animations and card interactions
3. WHEN users navigate through screens THEN the system SHALL maintain the same color scheme, typography, and spacing as the original app
4. WHEN users view any screen THEN the system SHALL display the same layout structure and component positioning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to go through the same onboarding experience in the Flutter app, so that I can learn about the app's features in a familiar way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app first launches THEN the system SHALL display the 4-slide onboarding sequence with auto-progression
2. WHEN users view each onboarding slide THEN the system SHALL show the correct icons, titles, and descriptions for each feature
3. WHEN users interact with pagination dots THEN the system SHALL allow manual navigation between slides
4. WHEN users tap "Skip" or complete onboarding THEN the system SHALL navigate to the sign-in screen
5. WHEN the final slide displays THEN the system SHALL show a "Get Started" button that completes onboarding

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to sign in and sign up using the same authentication flow, so that I can access my account consistently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the sign-in screen THEN the system SHALL display email and password input fields with proper validation
2. WHEN users enter invalid credentials THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages
3. WHEN users successfully sign in THEN the system SHALL navigate to the main app dashboard
4. WHEN users tap social sign-in buttons THEN the system SHALL show "Coming Soon" messages (placeholder functionality)
5. WHEN users navigate between sign-in and sign-up THEN the system SHALL maintain form state and visual consistency
6. WHEN users interact with password fields THEN the system SHALL provide show/hide password toggle functionality

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access the main dashboard with the same features and layout, so that I can continue using the app's core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users successfully authenticate THEN the system SHALL display the main dashboard with welcome message and feature cards
2. WHEN users view the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show the SmartBudget AI branding and animated logo
3. WHEN users interact with feature cards THEN the system SHALL display the same three features: Set Income, AI Analysis, and Save More
4. WHEN users tap the logout button THEN the system SHALL return to the sign-in screen
5. WHEN the dashboard loads THEN the system SHALL display the success checkmark icon and welcome text

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flutter app to use the same project structure and dependencies where possible, so that maintenance and future development remain consistent.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the Flutter project THEN the system SHALL organize components into logical folders (screens, widgets, services, models)
2. WHEN implementing animations THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's built-in animation framework to replicate 3D effects
3. WHEN implementing glassmorphism effects THEN the system SHALL use appropriate Flutter packages for blur and transparency
4. WHEN managing app state THEN the system SHALL implement proper state management (Provider, Riverpod, or Bloc)
5. WHEN handling navigation THEN the system SHALL use Flutter's navigation system to replicate the current flow

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the Flutter app to support the same platforms (iOS, Android, Web), so that we maintain cross-platform compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building for iOS THEN the system SHALL compile and run with native iOS performance
2. WHEN building for Android THEN the system SHALL compile and run with native Android performance  
3. WHEN building for Web THEN the system SHALL compile and run in web browsers with responsive design
4. WHEN testing on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and usability
5. WHEN deploying to app stores THEN the system SHALL meet platform-specific requirements and guidelines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the Flutter app to have the same performance characteristics and responsiveness, so that the user experience remains smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN animations play THEN the system SHALL maintain 60fps performance on target devices
2. WHEN screens load THEN the system SHALL display content within 2 seconds on average network conditions
3. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide immediate visual feedback
4. WHEN the app handles user input THEN the system SHALL respond without noticeable lag
5. WHEN memory usage is monitored THEN the system SHALL not exceed reasonable memory limits for mobile devices

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to preserve the existing data models and business logic, so that the migration focuses on UI framework changes rather than functional changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing user models THEN the system SHALL maintain the same data structure for user authentication
2. WHEN handling app state THEN the system SHALL preserve the same state transitions (onboarding → signin → main)
3. WHEN managing user sessions THEN the system SHALL implement the same session handling logic
4. WHEN validating user input THEN the system SHALL apply the same validation rules for email and password
5. WHEN handling errors THEN the system SHALL display the same error messages and user feedback
